// In-process resupply worker.
//
// History
// -------
// This used to live in artifacts/resupply-worker as a separate
// artifact / process. The split bought crash isolation but cost a
// whole artifact (its own artifact.toml, build pipeline, healthz
// server, deploy gate, workflow) for a workload that is overwhelmingly
// quiet — an hourly reminder scan and a weekly attachment sweep, both
// driven by pg-boss against the same Postgres instance the API
// already talks to.
//
// The original design also explicitly anticipated colocation: the
// API's /readyz check probes the same `pgboss_resupply.version` table
// the worker's pg-boss instance creates, and gates traffic on it. The
// only thing the separation actually bought was an extra process to
// monitor.
//
// Now: pg-boss boots inside the API process. The /readyz check still
// works the same way (the schema is created by boss.start() — no
// matter which process calls it), and one shutdown handler covers
// both. If the resupply program ever needs throughput-class workloads
// that genuinely deserve their own process (high-frequency call queue
// processing, embedding generation, anything CPU-bound), splitting
// back out is a contained change — re-extract this directory back
// into an artifact and add the orchestration plumbing.
